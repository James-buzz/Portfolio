<Link href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</Link> is a Javascript package that makes it easy to create visual graphics in the browser.
 These visuals are created by p5.js using the html <Code>&#60;canvas&#62;</Code> element.

The HTML <Code>&#60;canvas&#62;</Code> element is used to draw graphics in javascript on the fly. 
The <Code>&#60;canvas&#62;</Code> element is simply a container for graphics.
To create the graphics on canvas, you can utilise Javascript. 
You must use Javascript to actually draw the graphics. 
Canvas includes a variety of tools for creating paths, boxes, circles, text, and images.

Here is an example of what you can do with Canvas using ball physics:

<Frame height={400} src="//jsfiddle.net/James_buzz/6d4q2Lop/16/embedded/result/dark/"></Frame>

You need to install these libraries to integrate p5.js into react. 

```js
npm i --save p5 react-p5
```

<Heading slug="the-code" as="h1">The code</Heading>

Now we are ready to write some code.

We will start by creating a new React component that will render the react-p5 Sketch component. 
The Sketch component will handle the canvas and allow you to input your p5.js sketches.

```ts
import Sketch from "react-p5";
import p5Types from "p5";

const p5Component = () => {
    const setup = (p5: p5Types, canvasRef: any) => {
        // Setup Canvas here
    }
    const draw = (p5: p5Types) => {
        // Draw HTML5 Canvas here
    }
    return <Sketch setup={setup} draw={draw} />
}

export default p5Component;
```

You can use the <Link href="https://editor.p5js.org/">p5.js editor</Link> online to create your graphic sketches
beforehand and then integrate them into this React component.

You can see examples of p5.js sketches at <Link href="https://p5js.org/examples/">p5js.org/examples/</Link>.

Here we will set up the canvas with the width of 500px and 400px. We will also include drawing two eclipses and an orange background.

```ts
import Sketch from "react-p5";
import p5Types from "p5";

const p5Component = () => {
    const setup = (p5: p5Types, canvasRef: any) => {
        p5.createCanvas(500, 400).parent(canvasRef);
    }
    const draw = (p5: p5Types) => {
        p5.background(255, 130, 20)
        p5.ellipse(100, 100, 100)
        p5.ellipse(300, 100, 100)
    }
    return <Sketch setup={setup} draw={draw} />
}

export default p5Component;
```

You can include the width and height of the canvas as Props

```ts
import Sketch from "react-p5";
import p5Types from "p5";

interface Props {
    width: number;
    height: number;
}

const p5Component = ({width, height}: Props) => {
    const setup = (p5: p5Types, canvasRef: any) => {
        p5.createCanvas(width, height).parent(canvasRef);
    }
    const draw = (p5: p5Types) => {
        p5.background(255, 130, 20)
        p5.ellipse(100, 100, 100)
        p5.ellipse(300, 100, 100)
    }
    return <Sketch setup={setup} draw={draw}/>
}

export default p5Component;
```

The following is the html canvas output of the code above.

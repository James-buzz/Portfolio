Welcome to the world of WS2812 light strips! 
These versatile and customisable LED strips have become very popular for various lighting 
projects. 
In this simple guide, we'll explain what they are, how they work, and some cool ways 
to use them.

WS2812 light strips, sometimes called "Neopixel" strips, are a type of individually 
controllable RGB LED strip. This means you can control each LED on the strip separately, 
letting you create amazing lighting effects. Each strip is made up of several WS2812 
integrated light sources, which are tiny LED chips with built-in control circuits.

WS2812 light strips work using a unique communication protocol. 
Each WS2812 LED module has a tiny built-in microcontroller that receives, 
processes, and forwards data signals along the strip. 
This allows you to precisely control the colour and brightness of each LED.

The communication protocol uses a single data line to send information to the LEDs. 
This data line carries a series of pulses that tell each LED what colour and brightness 
to be. 
The microcontroller in each WS2812 module reads these pulses, sets the LED's colour 
and brightness, and forwards the remaining data down the line. 
This clever system is what makes WS2812 light strips so versatile and customisable.

WS2812 light strips are popular for many different uses, including:

- <b>Home Decoration:</b> Use WS2812 light strips to create mood lighting, highlight features in your home, or add a splash of colour to any room. They're also great for making custom holiday decorations.
- <b>Stage and Event Lighting:</b> Their ability to create complex lighting effects makes WS2812 light strips perfect for stage lighting or as part of larger light installations at events, concerts, or art exhibitions.
- <b>Wearables and Fashion:</b> WS2812 light strips are flexible and low power, so they're great for integrating into clothing, accessories, and wearable devices. This has led to their use in fashion shows, costumes, and interactive clothing.
- <b>Automotive Lighting:</b> Use WS2812 light strips to create custom car lighting, both inside and outside your vehicle.
- <b>Gaming and Computer Accessories:</b> Gamers and computer enthusiasts love using WS2812 light strips to create unique keyboard backlights, PC case lighting, and other peripherals.

<Heading slug="history" as="h1">A brief history</Heading>

WS2812 light strips have their roots in the development of addressable RGB LEDs. 
RGB (Red, Green, Blue) LEDs, which emerged in the 1990s, could produce a wide range 
of colours by combining the three primary colours. 
However, controlling each LED independently within a strip was complex and limited their 
practical uses.

In 2011, WorldSemi introduced the WS2811 LED driver, which made it possible to control RGB
LEDs using a single data line. This led to the creation of flexible, addressable LED strips.
However, the WS2811 driver was a separate chip that needed to be connected to the RGB LEDs.

In 2013, WorldSemi revolutionised the world of addressable LEDs by introducing the WS2812, 
an integrated light source that combined an RGB LED and a control circuit in one tiny 
package. This made the manufacturing process simpler, reduced the size of each module, 
and allowed for higher-density LED arrangements on strips. WS2812 light strips quickly 
became popular thanks to their ease of use, flexibility,

WS2812 light strips have inspired countless creators to develop innovative projects 
showcasing the full potential of these programmable LEDs. 
Here are three impressive projects from the WS2812 community:

- Music-Reactive Lighting with LedFX: Music-reactive lighting synchronises the LED strip's colours and patterns with the beats and rhythms of the music. This is achieved using LedFX, an open-source software that analyses audio input and generates corresponding lighting effects for WS2812 light strips. The result is a captivating, immersive audio-visual experience that can elevate any party, event, or personal entertainment setup.

To learn more about setting up music-reactive lighting with LedFX and WS2812 light strips,

In the 1980s, <a href={'https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/'}>Craig Reynolds</a> developed a flocking
model that simulates the approximate behaviours of birds, fish, or whatever might
make entities move and flock to one another. Flocking is made up of three simple forces,
that when combined, cause the entities to flock like birds.

These forces are:
1. Alignment: Keep in the same direction as your neighbors.
2. Separation: Don&apos;t get too close to your neighbors.
3. Cohesion: Stay near your neighbors.

Alignment is the tendency to move in the same direction as a group.
For example, when you walk down stairs with a group of friends, 
you tend to move down the stairs together.
This is because the force of alignment keeps your body and limbs moving in 
sync with those around you so that there&apos;s no friction between them.

In flocking simulation, 
alignment refers to how closely birds are packed together—the closer they get,
the more likely they will collide with each other. 
The greater their density, or “clutter factor” (CF), 
the more it becomes harder for them to avoid crashing 
into each other due to their proximity and their inability—or 
unwillingness—to turn around quickly enough when needed

<Heading slug="seperation" as="h2">Seperation</Heading>

The separation force is a repulsive force that keeps the birds from getting
too close to each other.
In this example, it&apos;s proportional to the distance between the birds and
inversely proportional to the square of that distance.

<Heading slug="cohesion" as="h2">Cohesion</Heading>

In Flocking, you need to stay near your neighbors.
This means that you should not be too far away from them and also that they 
shouldn't be too close. Cohesion is the tendency of a group to move as a whole entity,
rather than individual objects or animals moving separately in random directions.

For example: If we have three birds flying around in a flock,
then there are two types of cohesion between these bodies:
- Physical/physical attraction – Birds will fly toward each other due to their physical properties (like feathers).
- Social/social attraction – Birds will fly toward others based on their social status or relationship with other members of the flock (if one bird is dominant over another).

<Heading slug="result" as="h2">The result</Heading>

The result of combining all three forces: Alignment, Separation, and Cohesion is a flocking simulation that approximates the behaviours of birds, fish, or any other organism that moves and flocks to one another.
